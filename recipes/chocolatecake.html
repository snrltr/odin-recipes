        <li>200g (1 ¾ cups) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>75g (⅔ cup) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>200g (1 cup) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>100g (½ cup) brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>240ml (1 cup) whole milk</li>
        <li>120ml (½ cup) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>240ml (1 cup) boiling water or hot coffee (for enhanced chocolate flavor)</li>
        <h4>For The Frosting</h4>
        <li>170g (¾ cup) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>300g (2 ½ cups) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>75g (⅔ cup) cocoa powder</li>
        <li>60ml (¼ cup) milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li><strong>Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F):</strong> Grease and line two 8-inch (20cm) round cake pans with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together both sugars, eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla until smooth. Gradually mix wet into dry ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Add hot water/coffee:</strong> Slowly stir in the boiling water or hot coffee. The batter will be thin - that's normal. </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Divide batter evenly between the two pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. </li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the frosting:</strong> Beat butter until creamy, then sift in powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Add milk, vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Frost the top of one cake layer, add the second layer, and cover the entire cake with the remaining frosting.</li>
    </ol>
