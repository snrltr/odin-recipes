    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>170g (¾ cup) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>200g (1 cup) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>150g (¾ cup packed) brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs + 1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>90g (¾ cup) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>100g (¾ cup) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>120g (¾ cup) dark chocolate chips or chunks (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li><strong>Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F):</strong> Grease or line an 8-inch (20cm) square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a slight overhang for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the butter:</strong> In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Remove from heat and whisk in both sugars until combined and glossy. </li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> Whisk in the eggs and yolk, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. </li>
        <li><strong>Add dry ingredients:</strong> Sift in the cocoa powder, flour, and salt. Stir gently until just combined - don't overmix. Fold in chocolate chips or chunks if using.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter). </li>
        <li><strong>Cool & serve:</strong> Let brownies cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then lift out using the parchment overhang. Cool completely before slicing into squares for clean edges and maximum fudginess. </li>
    </ol>
