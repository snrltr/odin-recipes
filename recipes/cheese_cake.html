    <ul>
        <h4>For The Crust</h4>
        <li>1 ½ cups (150g) graham cracker or digestive biscuit crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <h4>For The Filling</h4>
        <li>900g (2 lbs) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (160ml) sour cream</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (160ml) heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li><strong>Preheat oven to 160°C (325°F):</strong> Line the bottom of a 9-inch (23cm) springform pan with parchment paper and lightly grease the sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the crust:</strong> In a bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the filling:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy (about 2 minutes). Add sugar and vanilla; beat until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each until just blended. Stir in sour cream and heavy cream until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the filling over the crust and smooth the top. Place the pan in a larger baking dish and fill the outer dish with hot water (water bath) to halfway up the sides of the springform pan (optional but helps prevent cracking).Bake for 55-65 minutes, until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and chill:</strong> Turn off the oven, crack the door, and let the cheesecake cool inside for 1 hour. Remove from oven and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake before releasing the springform pan. Serve plain or top with fruit, chocolate sauce, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
